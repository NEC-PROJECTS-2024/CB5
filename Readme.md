### INTRODUCTION
Music genre classification is a pivotal area of research within audio technology, holding 
immense importance for content organization and recommendation. Audio feature extraction and 
Music genre classification constitute a complete recognition system. Audio feature analysis and 
Music genre classification together form an integrated recognition system for comprehensive 
music genre identification and organization. This technology is frequently utilized to accurately 
detect and classify various types of music genres or characteristics present in audio signals, 
contributing significantly to the effective organization and recommendation of music content. Our 
experiment was conducted with the dataset from GTZAN that is taken from Kaggle repository. 
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are employed to train our model, which is subsequently 
utilized for the classification of music genres in audio signals.
